# broccoli-ember-script

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/kristianmandrup/broccoli-ember-script.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

A EmberScript filter for [Broccoli](https://github.com/joliss/broccoli). This plugin simply compiles EmberScript to JS for Broccoli to further process, allowing Broccoli to control things such as optimization.

## Broccoli filter for emberscript with ES6 and Ember CLI

See issue [#42](https://github.com/ghempton/ember-script/issues/42)

Perhaps we should also hardcode ES6 import Ember as the first line of every emberscript file?

`import Ember$ from 'ember'`

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev broccoli-ember-script
```

## Usage

```js
var filterEmberScript = require('broccoli-ember-script');
tree = filterEmberScript(tree, options);
```

### Options

#### bare

If `bare` is true, the EmberScript compiler will not emit a top-level
function wrapper:

```js
filterEmberScript(tree, {
  bare: true
})
```
